# saasSite

Full stacks project based on the "[Upskill](http://upskillcourses.com) Software-as-a-Service Ruby on Rails App" course. 
Completed project. Pretty fun, 10/10 would recommend and then regret and then recommend again. 

# What I Learned

* Creating and managing a full stack website. 
* What a "stack" is. 
* Stripe (or other online chargin) functionality and website integration.
* Ruby and Ruby On Rails syntax. 
* Git commit and branch handling.
